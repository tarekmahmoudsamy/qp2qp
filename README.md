# qp2qp
is an opensource "two fingers controlled virtual pen" for drawing on smartphones

You draw with your finger on the small screen which does not give you the potential to control your lines,
the drawing point will Always be  hidden under your finger and you can not control it to draw a perfect small circle... if you tried to draw the human  features you'll find them scattered in a funny way.

in qp2qp You always find the virtual pen in quite halfway between the index finger and thumb, and after a short period of practice  the brain automatically select the drawing point , and you can raise your fingers and begin drawing in a new point on the screen.

* one finger moves the screen to draw on a larger area than the smartphone screen
